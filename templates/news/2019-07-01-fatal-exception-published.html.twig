  <h2>A Fatal Exception Published!</h2>
  <p class='news-date'>July 1, 2019</p>
  <p>Scott's first novel, A Fatal Exception, has been published!</p>
  <p>In a bleak future where daily smog warnings are routine and the politicians are dirtier than the environment, the people of Chicago turn to private investigators like Seven Sinclair when they want a case solved right. Seven isn't like most detectives since he's an android. He's not like most androids either. He's quirky and brazen and he's not chained down by the government-imposed privacy regulations.</p>
  <p>Sergeant Antonio Rizzo is a good cop in a corrupt town, and he's getting too old for the job. He despises technology, and the robot is like the personification of his object of hatred.</p>
  <p>When Seven's investigation into a simple hack leads to murder and all evidence points to him, he's forced to catch the true killer while he tries to stay out of Rizzo's crosshairs.</p>
  <p>The novel is available for Kindle and paperback on Amazon.</p>
