{% block book_description %}
    <p>In a bleak future where daily smog warnings are routine and the politicians are dirtier than the environment, the people of Chicago turn to private investigators like Seven Sinclair when they want a case solved right. Seven isn't like most detectives since he's an android. He's not like most androids either. He's quirky and brazen and he's not chained down by the government-imposed privacy regulations.</p>
    <p>Sergeant Antonio Rizzo is a good cop in a corrupt town, and he's getting too old for the job. He despises technology, and the robot is like the personification of his object of hatred.</p>
    <p>When Seven's investigation into a simple hack leads to murder and all evidence points to him, he's forced to catch the true killer while he tries to stay out of Rizzo's crosshairs.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p class="mb-0">He is a superpower kind of hero who has an entertaining command of humor. There are some one-liners in the story that stopped me to allow for some hearty laughter. I asked myself, 'Did I read that right?' and then I would read it again and howl with mirth.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p class="mb-0">Unlike most stories which include hacking details, this one felt realistic and believable. I even feel like I also learned a little about hacking and security from reading it.</p>
