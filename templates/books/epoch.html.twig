{% block book_description %}
<p>In the near future where the world depends ever more heavily on technology, a sudden and unknown catastrophic event occurs rendering all electronics useless and simultaneously wipes the memories of all people. Now the inhabitants of the small town of Jerome must learn how to survive and rebuild society as well as their identities in this harsh new world.</p>

<p>A young man awakens with a throbbing migraine and no memories, not even able to recall his own name or face. He recounts his experiences throughout his struggle to rediscover himself, confronting prejudice and stereotypes along the way. He faces formidable foes, the foremost of which are his own inner demons. What is right and wrong, good and evil, is not always so clear cut.</p>

<p>In the wake of this cataclysm, the citizens of Jerome must cope with murder, death, disease, and power struggles, but they also have the opportunity to reinvent themselves, to find love and friendship in unexpected places, and to rebuild the world.</p>
