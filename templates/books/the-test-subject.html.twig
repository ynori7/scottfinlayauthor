{% block book_description %}
<p>Imagine being suddenly and violently ripped away from your home and everything you knew and brought to a strange and terrifying new world occupied a race of monstrous giants. This is exactly what happened to one poor soul whose life became a constant science experiment, leaving the pitiful human weakened to the point of immobility and blindness. Soon the only thing keeping the captive sane is the thought of escape from this surrealistic nightmare and revenge against the wardens and the beings they report to.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p class="mb-0">It is just so well written that you feel you are really inside that character's head and seeing through his eyes. Just when I thought that there was nothing new under the Sun, this story comes along.</p>
