<h1>About Scott</h1>

<div class='row'>
    <div class='col-md-6 mb-1'>
        <p>Scott Finlay, born in 1989 in the United States, is a professional software developer with an expertise in
            computer security. For many years he was active in the hacker scene and there known and respected as a
            skilled ethical hacker. In his daily life he designs complex systems, investigates disruptions, and
            sometimes tries unusual solutions by thinking outside the box. He draws on his architectural skills while
            designing his stories and his debugging skills are in many ways similar to those of a detective. He draws
            from his technical expertise, particularly regarding software and hacking topics in his writing.</p>

        <p>In 2012 Scott moved to Germany for love and started a family there. As an American living in Europe, he has
            a somewhat unique view on the world and its politics, and draws inspiration from many of the issues he sees
            in the world to build dystopian settings and make social commentary.</p>
