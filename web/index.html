It may
        surprise many (also within the two disciplines) to learn that the process of writing a book and that of
        writing software have quite a lot of similarities. The similarities are so profound, in fact, that tools and
        techniques used within one practice can be adapted and applied to the other to improve the process.</p><p>In the next paragraphs, I'll give a crash course on the different stages of software development and novel writing,
        underlining the parallels. I'll also demonstrate some of the enhancements I've been able to make by utilizing
        learnings from both worlds.</p><p>Before you actually start writing your story or your code, you need to... <a href='/articles/the-agile-development-of-a-novel'>Read more</a></p></section><section class="news"><div class='news-image'><a href='/the-galactic-idiot'><img src="/frontend/img/books/the-galactic-idiot.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="312" /></a></div><h2><a href='/news/2021/01-06-the-galactic-idiot-published'>The Galactic Idiot Published!</a></h2><p class='news-date'>January 6, 2021</p><p>Scott's third full-length novel, <a href='/the-galactic-idiot'>The Galactic Idiot</a>, has been published!</p><p>The trouble with Gary isn't his crooked teeth or the mole on his cheek. It isn't even the haircut which makes his head look like a bowling ball. The trouble with Gary is that he's a moron. But he's not just your average run-of-the-mill dimwit. Gary's idiocy is special because, unlike most idiots, he's stupid on a planetary level. Literally. The last thing he said before destroying the moon was, "Oops."</p><p>It all started the day Gary's uncle colonel Virgil Cross got him a job aboard Terra One, Earth's very first and most decrepit intergalactic space station. Gary had always wanted to be a space traveler and an adventurer despite his sheltered life. Growing up, he nourished himself with comic books and television, and was pretty sure that's how the universe worked.</p><p>After inadvertently causing the greatest catastrophe in human history, Gary is on the run from two of the galaxy's most powerful and least forgiving empires in a broken and unpredictable ship, encountering many diverse friends and enemies along the way including: Shii'an the always-cool seven-limbed rogue; Mon Arun, the a shape-shifting reptilian spy; Korg, the dour purple goliath who just wants to tinker with machines; Megatroll, the most dangerous computer worm in history trapped in a robot vacuum cleaner; and Queen Morgaan the omnipresent insectoid mother of a trillion mindless drones and a single daughter she'll protect at all costs.</p><p>The novel is available for Kindle and paperback on <a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08S7GBRZN' target='_blank'>Amazon</a>.</p></section><section class="news"><h2>Something New Is Coming</h2><p class='news-date'>November 16, 2020</p><div class="news-image"><img src="/frontend/img/teasers/the-galactic-idiot-teaser.jpg" alt="The Galactic Idiot" height="450"></div><p>Something new is coming soon...</p><br><p>Something different...</p><br><p>Something epic...</p><br><p>Something absurd...</p><div class="clearfix"></div></section><section class="news"><div class='news-image-right'><a href='/the-test-subject'><img src="/frontend/img/books/the-test-subject.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="312" /></a></div><h2><a href='/news/2019/10-10-the-test-subject-published'>The Test Subject Published!</a></h2><p class='news-date'>July 25, 2019</p><p>Scott's first short story, <a href='/the-test-subject'>The Test Subject</a>, is now published!</p><p>The story, told from a first-person point-of-view, centers around a nameless, genderless character. Suddenly torn out a deep slumber, the protagonist is abducted and brought to a harsh, cruel world inhabited by a race of hideous giants. These monsters perform a series of experiments, bringing the poor captive to the point of near blindness and paralysis.</p><p>After slowly regaining some limited mobility, the protagonist ventures to escape at all costs while taking vengence against the sadistic captors as they continue their terrifying experiments.</p><p>Download it on Kindle on <a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YYC6NTJ' target='_blank'>Amazon</a>.</p></section><section class="news"><div class='news-image'><a href='/epoch'><img src="/frontend/img/books/epoch.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="312" /></a></div><h2><a href='/news/2019/07-25-epoch-published'>Epoch Published!</a></h2><p class='news-date'>July 25, 2019</p><p>Scott's newest novel, <a href='/epoch'>Epoch</a>, was just published!</p><p>What if you woke up one morning lying on the floor, head pounding, and realized you had no idea what you were doing there? Even worse, what if you discovered you had no idea who you were or what your name was, and there was no way to find out because everyone else has lost all their memories as well? To top it off, what if all electronics suddenly stopped functioning at the same time?</p><p>This is precisely the situation one young man finds himself in. He's forced to try to rediscover his identity while struggling to find a path between what's right and what's necessary for survival. Sometimes the what's right and what's wrong aren't so easily discernible.</p><p>Forced to cope with a wasteland of useless, dead technology in a world that had grown to rely so heavily on machines, the people of Jerome must learn to rebuild society without the modern conveniences they depended upon so strongly. They suffer power struggles, death and disease, and are even forced to face the birth of a serial killer, all while fighting to reinvent themselves. Epoch is an epic of love, death, friendship, and inner struggles. It's a story uniting post-apocalyptic horror with philosophy and sociology.</p><p>This epic is available for Kindle and paperback on <a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VNHMCS9' target='_blank'>Amazon</a>.</p></section><section class="news"><h2><a href='/news/2019/07-16-coming-soon-epoch'>Coming Soon...Epoch!</a></h2><p class='news-date'>July 16, 2019</p><div class='news-image-right'><img src="/frontend/img/teasers/EpochTeaser3.png" alt="" width="195" /></div><p>Scott's next novel is coming soon. Epoch was actually the first novel Scott wrote, but it's a much longer, more complex story, so it took a bit more time to polish. It's a very different kind of story, more along the lines of speculative fiction. Epoch is a post-apocalyptic horror with a heavy focus on philosophy (in particular the topic of identity), ethics, morality, and sociology.</p><p>It's a "what if" story in which a mysterious catastrophic event occurs which disables all electronics and wipes all the memories of all people. Now everyone is forced to rediscover themselves and to learn how to survive in a harsh new world with no law and order.</p><p>More details will come soon.

He designed and built the site himself from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of PHP. For those interested in the technical details, it's using Twitter Bootstrap as the CSS framework and Twig templates in the backend. To make the site as fast-loading as possible, there's a PHP script which renders the Twig templates and saves them as plain .html files. All CSS and JavaScript files are merged together and minified so that they load quicker.</p><p>For the very tech-interested, you can check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/ynori7/scottfinlayauthor" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p></section></div><footer><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center"><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scott-Finlay/e/B07TXBTJHH" target='_blank'><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-amazon fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ScottFinlayAuthor" target='_blank'><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-facebook fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/a.world.of.darkness/" target='_blank'><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-instagram fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/SFinlayAuthor" target='_blank'><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li><li><a href="mailto:scottfinlayauthor@gmail.com" target='_blank'><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-envelope fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span></a></li></ul><ul class="list-inline text-center"><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li><li><a href="/privacy">Privacy</a></li></ul><p class="copyright text-center">&copy; 2021 Scott Finlay.
